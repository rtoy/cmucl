[--- WORK IN PROGRESS --- DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ---]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 18e.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bugfixes from the 18d release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:
       
  * Feature enhancements:
     - Karatsuba multiplier added to give faster multiplication for
       big bignums.
     - The sparc port has experimental support for native 64-bit
       integers (unsigned-byte 64) and (signed-byte 64) on sparc v9
       (64-bit) architectures.  Enabled if the feature :sparc-v8plus
       is set.
     - The x86 port better support for linking foreign libraries.  You
       can now dump cores with foreign libraries and reload the core
       without having to reload the libraries.  Available if the feature
       :linkage-table is set.

  * Numerous ANSI compliance fixes:
     - SYMBOL-MACROLET signals an error when an attempt is made to
       bind a special variable or a constant
     - WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING accepts the :external-format keyword
       argument
     - the function WRITE-STRING accepts a NIL value for the :end
       argument 
     - the function CHANGE-CLASS now accepts initargs
     - loops of the form (LOOP FOR I BY (INCF X) FROM ...) now work
     - in loop forms, the INITIALLY, FINALLY and DO keywords must be
       followed by a compound form
     - in the loop macro, PRESENT-SYMBOL now means both internal and
       external symbols of a package
     - the class precedence list of NULL has symbol before list
     - the function FLOAT-RADIX signals an error if its argument is
       not a float
     - an error is signaled if the lambda keyword &rest is not
       followed by a variable
     - the GENTEMP function no longer accepts arguments of type symbol
     - the function SHIFTF supports multiple values
     - compiler macros recognize calls of the form (funcall foo args)
     - (coerce <rational> '(complex float)) now returns a (complex
       float) rather than a rational
     - the ECASE and CCASE macros are allowed to use T and OTHERWISE
       as regular keys, instead of as the otherwise clause. CMUCL
       prints a warning about this being poor style.
     - the type (complex (eql 0)) is accepted now instead of
       generating an error.
     - the sequence functions check to make sure sequences are
       specified and that, if lengths are given, the result matches
       the given length.

  * Numerous bugfixes:
     - READ-BYTE on certain types of multi-byte elements was incorrect
     - fix the treatment of colon package delimiters for the ~/
       formatting directive
     - correction to CLX's handling of FamilyLocal authorization
       cookies (as created by versions of ssh after 3.4)
     - fix to CLX handling of :any event-spec ??
     - fix to boa-constructors ??
     - EXPT was not correctly handling a zero exponent
     - index calculations for operations bitvectors of sizes near the
       ARRAY-DIMENSION-LIMIT could overflow
     - redefining a class with a changed class precedence list didn't
       update the CMUCL type system
     - generated CLOS getter/setter/boundp generic functions are now
       declared correctly, to eliminate bogus undefined function
       warnings from the compiler
     - method combination options for the long form of the
       DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION special form work correctly
     - executing a defclass form with a metaclass of STRUCTURE-CLASS
       would result in the generation of recursive print-object
       methods, so that printing such instances would loop
     - dividing a ration by zero returned 1/0 instead of signaling an
       error
     - PPRINT-LOGICAL-BLOCK with a numeric prefix no longer causes the
       system to crash
     - in the byte-compiler, string comparisons STRING< and STRING>
       returned incorrect results
     - the function READ-SEQUENCE returned incorrect results for
       specialized arrays when the internal READ-N-BYTES function read
       short
     - when a sequence type specifies a length, CMUCL checks that the
       length of sequence arguments match the length of the sequence type
     - the function COMPILE-FILE-PATHNAME computes the output file
       name by merging the input file name and the supplied output file name
     - the functions MAKE-BROADCAST-STREAM, MAKE-TWO-WAY-STREAM,
       MAKE-CONCATENATED-STREAM and MAKE-ECHO-STREAM check that their
       argument is an input or output stream, as appropriate
     - numerous error conditions are signalled using a more specific
       condition type than a generic error
     - many (all?) cases where the unused labels functions were
       causing a compiler assertion error.
     - some cases where the compiler was incorrectly deriving the
       types of functions have been fixed.
     - error reporting in many areas have been improved to be more
       specific and/or ANSI compliant. 
     - error detection of defclass options in line with ANSI
       requirements. 

  * Other changes:
     - the function PROFILE:REPORT-TIME no longer prints out a long
       list of functions that were not profiled. The cutoff is
       user-configurable by setting the new variable
       PROFILE::*NO-CALLS-LIMIT*.
     - reinstated the ability to build small runtime images (excluding
       the compiler)
     - DESCRIBE will print a note if a symbol names a type-specifier
  
  * Code cleanups:

  * Changes to rebuilding procedure:
     - the search-list "modules:" tracks the "library:" search-list,
       instead of being set to whatever "library:subsystems/" is at
       startup. 
      

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
18d; you will need to recompile FASL files.

We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
