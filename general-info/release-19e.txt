[--- WORK IN PROGRESS --- DO NOT DISTRIBUTE ---]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 19e.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bugfixes from the 19d release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:

  * Supported system:
    - Support for Mac OS X/Intel has been added.

  * Feature enhancements:
    - Support for dynamic-extent added for ppc.  However, it suffers
      from the same problems with dynamic-extent as other platforms,
      so it is disabled by default.  Tests indicate that it does work
      in simple situations.
    - PARSE-TIME recognizes the format produced by C asctime/ctime.
      (This change may break some other less commonly used patterns.)
    - PARSE-TIME recognizes and discards any microseconds.
    - PARSE-TIME checks that a specified day of the week matches the
      actual day of the week given in the date.  An error is signaled
      if they are inconsistent. 
    - New option to SAVE-LISP allows creating executable Lisp images
      that do not require a runtime loader.
      Syntax: (save-lisp "filename" :executable t)
      Currently supported on FreeBSD and Linux; work on a Solaris
      version is underway.
      Limitations: depends on files in "library:" to dump new
      executable images.
    - CMUCL's version of CLX has been replaced with telent CLX.
    - Preliminary support for external formats.  Currently only
      iso8859-1 and utf-8 are supported.  Utf-8 support is limited
      since CMUCL only has 8-bit characters.
    - UNIX-MPROTECT added to access mprotect.

  * ANSI compliance fixes:
    - BOA constructors with &AUX variables are handled better now.
    - SHADOW accepts characters now.
    - Default initargs are now passed correctly to initialize-instance
      and shared-initialize.

  * Bugfixes:
    - Floating-point traps are now handled on ppc.  Previously, no
      traps were signalled and SET-FLOATING-POINT-MODES did nothing.
    - FILE-POSITION no longer returns negative values for mapped
      file-simple-stream's.
    - Potential Version numbers that start with a leading 0 are no
      longer treated as version numbers.  Hence, "foo.~1~" has name
      "foo", type nil, and version 1, but "foo.~01~" has type "~01~"
      and version :NEWEST.
    - A bug in type derivation for EXPT has been fixed.  (expt x y)
      for x of type (double-float (0d0) 1d0) and y of type
      (double-float (0d0)) now returns (or (member 0d0) (double-float
      (0d0) 1d0)) instead of (double-float 0d0 1d0), i.e., -0d0 is not
      in the range.
    - On sparc, the decoding of a trapping FP instruction is correct
      now.  Previously the wrong instruction was decoded, which
      produced the wrong operation and operands in the arithmetic
      error handler.
    - Fix issue with UNIX:UNIX-MMAP handling of "large" addresses that
      appeared to be negative numbers.
    - DOUBLE-DOUBLE-FLOAT fixes:
      o Converting negative rationals to double-double-float's doesn't
	produce wrong answers anymore.
      o Conversion of bignums to double-double-floats preserves more
	bits of the bignum now.  This allows for read/print consistency
	for this particular case.  (The general case is still broken.)
      o (float <negative bignum> 1w0) no longer returns a positive
	result.
      o Some issues with creation of DOUBLE-DOUBLE-FLOAT and (COMPLEX
	DOUBLE-DOUBLE-FLOAT) have been fixed on sparc, ppc, and x86.
	These seem to work, except there appears to be some bugs on x86
	when compiling at speed 3 and safety 0.
      o (INTEGER-DECODE-FLOAT <double-double-float>) was sometimes
	returning the wrong integer value because the two components had
	the wrong sign.
      o Some issues with debugger printing out DOUBLE-DOUBLE-FLOATs and
	(COMPLEX DOUBLE-DOUBLE-FLOAT)'s have been fixed.
      o CLOS now recognizes that (COMPLEX DOUBLE-DOUBLE-FLOAT) is a
        valid built-in class instead of a random object.
      o Branch cuts for ASIN and ATANH for double-double-float's
        should match the branches for double-float's.
      o ATAN2 should correctly handle signed double-double-float
        zeroes.
      o FASL files containing -0w0 are now converted to -0w0 instead
        of 0w0.
      o SIN and TAN return -0w0 when the argument is -0w0.
        Previously, they returned 0w0.
      o Signed zeroes are handled better for addition, subtraction,
        and multiplication.  That is, the correct signed zero is
        returned now.
      o Overflow in addition, multiplication, and division returns
        infinity if traps are disabled.
      o EQL supports DOUBLE-DOUBLE-FLOAT's now.
      o The printer and reader should now be consistent for
        double-double-floats. 
      o Conversion of bignums and ratios to double-double-floats
        should be more accurate.
      o Double-double-float's should have print/read consistency now.
    - The assembler for ppc had some arguments for some instructions
      in the wrong order, producing the wrong effect. 
    - When making displaced arrays, the element types are checked to
      see if they are type equivalent.  If not, an error is signaled.
    - The reader for #= and ## has been enhanced to be much faster for
      cases with a large number of shared objects.  However, it is also
      somewhat slower for simple cases.
    - #p"..." now has a namestring and is treated as a pathname with
      name ".." and type "".
    - #p"..a" erroneously had directory (:relative).  This has been
      fixed so that directory = nil, name = ".", and type = "a".
    - Compiling code using SIGNUM no longer causes a compiler error.
      The defoptimizer for SIGNUM was missing a case for
      double-double-float. 
    - MAPHASH no longer causes a type-error when the mapping function
      calls (setf gethash) on the same table.
    - NOTINLINE declarations are honored for local functions even if
      they only have only one use.  Previously, these would be inlined
      anyway.  This allows tracing of such functions.
    - TRACE and UNTRACE should now work as expected for local
      labels/flet functions.  Untracing should work.  Redefining a
      function should automatically retrace the local functions if
      they were traced previously.
    - Callbacks should now work on systems where malloc'ed space does
      not normally allow execution of code.
    - The FLOAT-ACCURACY declaration has been removed.  This should
      have no affect on most user's code, unless they were using
      this.  The default is 53-bit (double-float) precision for
      everything and the compiler takes care of the precision for the
      appropriate ABI.  It is the compiler's responsibility to make
      sure single-precision floats are done correctly with
      single-precision results.
    - A compiler bug with type inferencing and deleting unsued
      functions has been fixed.
    - A compiler bug has been fixed where a source transformation was
      applied because the local variable happens to have a function
      type.
    - On Darwin/x86, tracing with :encapsulate nil works better, and
      tracing of labels/flets works better.  However, there are still
      issues with tracing.  Returning to the repl after tracing
      sometimes fails, and you must exit lisp completely.

  * Trac Tickets:
    - #8 fixed so logs of bignums and ratios that won't fit into a
      float can be computed, instead of signalling an error.
    - #9 fixed.  An error is generated if the number of days doesn't
      match the number of days in the given month.
    - #10 fixed.  ROUND should now return correct answers for floats
      bigger than most-positive-fixnum.
    - #11 fixed.  EQL handles double-double-float's correctly now.
    - #1 fixed.  prin1 and ~E should produce the same results.
    - #12 fixed.  (format t "~10,1,2,0,'*,,'DE" 1d-6) prints "0.1D-05"
      now.

  * Other changes:
    - UNIX:UNIX-ERRNO accesses the thread errno value instead of the
      global errno value.
    - Floating point zero is now printed with an exponent of zero,
      independent of any scale factor that might be used.  Thus, we
      get results like "0.0D+00" instead of "0.0D-5".

  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:
    - Forward-referenced classes are allowed.

  * Changes to rebuilding procedure:
    - load-world.sh now supports a -p option to load the world without
      PCL.  This is mostly for cross-compiling which doesn't want PCL
      loaded because it's not build during a cross-compile.
    - make-dist.sh now defaults to bzip compression instead of gzip.


This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
19d; you will need to recompile FASL files.
