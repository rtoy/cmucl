========================== C M U C L  20 a =============================

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 20a.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bugfixes from the 19f release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:

  * Known issues:
    - On Linux and FreeBSD, it may not be possible call SAVE-LISP and
      create executables.  This seems to be broken on FreeBSD.  On
      Linux, it seems to depend on what version of Linux is used to
      create the executable.  Redhat Enterprise Linux appears to be
      ok, but Open SuSE 10.x is not.

  * Feature enhancements:
    - Support for Unicode has been added.  You have Unicode support if
      *FEATURES* includes :UNICODE.
      o CHAR-CODE-LIMIT is 65536.  
      o There is only one character type;  CHARACTER and BASE-CHAR are
        the same types.
      o There is only one string type; STRING and BASE-STRING are the
        same type. All strings are UTF-16 strings and therefore
        contain UTF-16 surrogate pairs.  While most string functions
        correctly handle surrogate pairs, not all do.  It is up to the
        user to handle this.  In particular, processing of strings on
        a character-by-character basis will need to handle surrogate
        pairs. 
      o External formats are supported.  Functions that need to know
        the external format take an :EXTERNAL-FORMAT keyword argument
        to specify the format.
        + The special variable STREAM:*DEFAULT-EXTERNAL-FORMAT*
          specifies the default format to be used for all streams.
          The default value is :iso8859-1. 
        + The standard streams, *standard-input*, *standard-output*,
          and *standard-error* all default to
          *default-external-format* (which itself defaults to
          :iso8859-1).  You can change the encoding used for these
          streams by calling STREAM:SET-SYSTEM-EXTERNAL-FORMAT to set
          the encoding for all three streams.  Alternatively, you can
          use (setf external-format) to change the format for each
          stream.
        + Many external formats are supported.  The complete list is
          in aliases, but we support at least :ISO-8859-1, :UTF-8,
          :UTF-16, :UTF-32, :CRLF.
       o CHAR-LESSP and friends perform case-folding by converting to
         lowercase.  (The non-Unicode version converted to uppercase.)
       o STRING<, STRING>, and friends compare strings in codepoint order.
       o STRING-LESSP, STRING-GREATERP, and friends compare strings in
         codepoint order after doing a case-folding operation on each
         codepoint.  The case-folding operation converts each
         codepoint to the corresponding lowercase codepoint.
       o UTF16-STRING-P checks to see if a string is a valid UTF-16
         encoded string.
       o Unicode normalization forms are supported via STRING-TO-NFC,
         STRING-TO-NFKC, STRING-TO-NFD, and STRING-TO-NFKD.
       o Symbols are always normalized to NFC form.

    - WRITE-VECTOR and READ-VECTOR support vectors of with element
      sizes of 1 bit, 2 bits and 4 bits.  For :NETWORK-ORDER, the
      bytes are written such that the lowest indexed element is
      written to the most significant part of a byte.

  * ANSI compliance fixes:
    - MERGE-PATHNAMES no longer generates pathnames whose directory
      component doesn't start with either :ABSOLUTE or :RELATIVE.
      MERGE-PATHNAMES also signals errors if the generated pathname
      directory is invalid (such as :ABSOLUTE followed by :BACK).

  * Bugfixes:
    - CMUCL sometimes gets "stuck" during compilation where it is
      trying to simplify the union of a large number of disjoint
      numeric types.  Previously, we handled the case of integer
      types.  Extend this to handle floats as well.
    - SXHASH was computing the same hash code for upper and lower case
      characters by upcasing the character.  This isn't necessary
      since the characters are not EQUAL, so make SXHASH return
      different values for upper and lower case letter.
    - WRITE-VECTOR was not writing out enough data when no
      byte-swapping is needed and the end index was not given.
      (Confusion about the length of the vector versus the index as an
      octet count, not element count.)
    - Motif (CLM) should work with Unicode.
    - The stream created by WITH-INPUT-FROM-STREAM was not properly
      closed.
    - SXHASH was returning different values for -0f0 and -0d0 for
      compiled and interpreted code.  They both return the same value
      now.
    - Some issues with potential spurious floating-point exceptions
      with complex arithmetic on x86 with SSE2 have been fixed.
      (Random junk in unused parts of an sse2 register could cause
      spurious FP exceptions.)
    - Numeric contagion for complex + real and complex - real was not
      done correctly in compiled code.  Proper contagion is now done
      by converting the real to a complex before performing the
      operation. 
    - CMUCL can now handle the X11 local Unix display connection on
      Mac OS X.
    - SETF-SLOT-VALUE-USING-CLASS-DFUN no longer signals errors when
      checking the new value against the declared slot type when the
      declared slot type was too hairy for TYPEP.
    - GENTEMP no longer generates the wrong symbol if the
      pretty-printer is used.
    - Some issues with slow allocation with gencgc have been worked
      around.  Certain allocation sequences were causing all
      allocations to be done out-of-line into an almost full
      allocation region.  This was especially evident on sparc and ppc
      when running the ansi test suite from gcl on a unicode build.
      CMUCL will attempt to detect this and abandon the region,
      allowing inline allocation to be done again.
    - For x86 builds, the floating-point precision was incorrectly set
      to 64 bits (long-float) instead of 53 bits (double-float).  This
      is fixed now.

  * Trac Tickets:
    #31: pathname bug with :case :common
    Fixed.  The common case is applied to each part of the directory,
    not to the directory as a whole.

  * Other changes:
    - SOFTWARE-VERSION may return different results than previously.
      UNIX:UNIX-UNAME is now used to obtain the software version on
      Linux and Solaris.
    - User's manual updated with a section on internationalization
      (unicode).
    - DESCRIBE on characters includes the character's code and name.
    - CLX updated to the portable clx version from Christophe Rhodes
      darcs repository of 2009-06-16.
    - make-dist.sh will also install the source code in the specified
      directory if -I and -S are given.
    - CMUCL contribs (in the src/contribs directory) are now
      distributed as part of extras package.  The contribs can be
      loaded by first using (require "cmu-contribs").  Then the
      individual contribs can be loaded with require.  The available
      contribs are, "contrib-demos", "contrib-follow-mouse",
      "contrib-games-feebs", "contrib-hist", "contrib-psgraph",
      "contrib-ops", "contrib-embedded-c", "contrib-sprof".  The names
      must be given as lower case strings.  These are not officially
      supported as part of CMUCL, but users may find them useful.

  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:

  * Changes to building procedure:
    - The sparc config fils are now named sparc_gcc and sparc_sunc,
      which use gcc and Sun C, respectively, for the C compiler.  Only
      Solaris is supported.  The old sun4_solaris_gcc and
      sun4_solaris_sunc configs are deprecated.

  * Known issues:
    - The :executable feature, while enabled for FreeBSD and Linux,
      may not be working.

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
19f; you will need to recompile FASL files.

We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
