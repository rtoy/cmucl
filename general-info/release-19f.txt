[--- WORK IN PROGRESS ---]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 19f.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bugfixes from the 19e release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multimethods and a metaobject protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:


  * Feature enhancements:
    - ~R supports many more cardinal names.
    - Updated network support:
      o Added BIND-INET-SOCKET to bind a socket to a local address.
      o Added OPEN-NETWORK-STREAM to create a stream connected to a given host.
      o Added ACCEPT-NETWORK-STREAM to create a stream connected to
        the new network connection
      o Updated CONNECT-TO-INET-SOCKET to allow binding the newly
        created socket to a local address
    - Added UNIX:UNIX-OPENPTY, an interface to the openpty C library
      function.
    - SSE2 support added for x86.
      o CMUCL automatically detects whether sse2 is supported or not
        and loads up the appropriate core file.
      o New -fpu switch allows the user to specify explicitly which
        core should be used.  The valid values are x87, sse2, or auto
        (the default).
      o Fasls compiled with sse2 support have the extension sse2f.
        Otherwise, the normal x86f extension is used.  This allows the
        user to do tests/experiments with both x87 and sse2 without
        having to mess around with different directories and removing
        fasls before building for a different FPU.
      o If the chip supports sse2, but CMUCL can't find the sse2 core,
        CMUCL will try to fall back to the x87 core.  (This only
        happens if -fpu is auto.)
    - Command line parsing now recognizes the option "--".  Everything
      after "--" is not subject to CMUCL's command line parsing, and
      everything after the "--" is placed in the new variable
      EXT:*COMMAND-LINE-APPLICATION-ARGUMENTS*. 

  * ANSI compliance fixes:
    - Fix bug in backquote printer.  If the variable is @foo, we want
      to print ", @foo" not ",@foo".  Similarly, for .foo, we want to
      print ", .foo" instead of ",.foo".
    - Fix merging of version in MAKE-PATHNAME.  If the pathname name
      is given, the version is not affected by the version in the
      default pathname.
    - RENAME-FILE now creates defaulted-new-name from merging new-name
      with the original filespec.  This is an incompatible change from
      the previous version which created defaulted-new-name from
      merging the new-name with the truename of filespec.  Also, a
      logical pathname should be returned if new-name is a logical
      pathname. 
    - Character names need to be a capital letter followed by lower
      case.  Needed to match what ~:C does.  (Found via ansi-tests).

  * Bugfixes:
    - Compiler can now derive the rank of an array, even if the array
      is not simple.
    - Fix off-by-one bug in ~R which prevents printing numbers from
      10^63 to 10^66-1.  10^63 is a vigintillion.
    - The compiler and interpreter should now handle slot-value the
      same.  Previously, different results were returned for things
      like (slot-value foo :a).
    - UNIX-GETGRNAM is now defined for Darwin (x86 and ppc).
    - UNIX-GETPWUID is defined for all BSD systems.
    - Type-derivation for EXPT no longer causes errors in some
      situations.  The computed bounds were of the wrong type for the
      resulting type specifier.
    - Pathname printer no longer produces an error for (MAKE-PATHNAME
      :HOST NIL :TYPE "foo").  It returns #P(:HOST NIL :TYPE "foo")
      now. 
    - Type derivation for DOUBLE-DOUBLE-FLOAT arithmetic should be
      working.  Previously, all arithmetic operations would just
      return DOUBLE-DOUBLE-FLOAT even though the compiler should have
      been able to figure out a tighter result.
    - When SCALE-FLOAT would underflow, it would always return 0f0,
      instead of a floating-point zero of the correct type.
    - Fix some issues in creating the debug arglist string when the
      arglist contains items that can't be printed readably.
    - DIRECTORY is now faster for directories with a large number of
      files.  
    - RANDOM is now much faster on all platforms for numbers upto
      #xffffffff.  This is an incompatible change from previous
      releases because the numbers produced may be different from
      before.  
    - The small bias in RANDOM for integer args up to 32 bits long
      should now be gone.
    - Improved type derivation for LOGAND when one arg is bounded but
      the other is not.
    - Some issues with tracing on sparc and ppc have been fixed.  This
      usually manifests itself with a segfault just after the function
      result is printed.
    - Fixed bug on sparc where C-c sometimes causes a segfault.  We
      now handle the case where siginfo_t is NULL, which can also
      happen on other architectures.
    - The interpreter catches invalid EVAL-WHEN situations just like
      the compiler, instead of silently ignoring them.
    - FLOAT-PRECISION supports double-double floats.
    - Tracing should now be working on Darwin/x86.  Previously,
      certain cases would cause Lisp to segfault in bad ways where you
      could not return to the repl.
    - The bounds for type (REAL lo hi) are computed better now.  The
      REAL type is a union of SINGLE-FLOAT, DOUBLE-FLOAT, and
      DOUBLE-DOUBLE-FLOAT.  The computed bounds for
      DOUBLE-DOUBLE-FLOAT only had double-float accuracy if the bound
      for REAL was a rational.
    - The FLOAT type now requires that the bounds, if given, are
      floats.  Previously, any real type would be accepted.  This
      makes FLOAT behave like SINGLE-FLOAT and DOUBLE-FLOAT which
      required the bounds to be a float of the appropriate type.

  * Trac Tickets:
    - #16: Read-time hash-table issue
      Fixed.
    - #17: LOOP NAMED NIL has no effect
      Fixed.
    - #18: Modular arith bug 1
      Fixed
    - #19: Modular arith bug 2
      Fixed by not doing modular arith if the args are known to be
      fixnums.
    - #20: Modular arith bug?
      Fixed via the fix for Trac #21.  The original workaround has
      been removed.
    - #24: Float contagion for expt
      Float contagion is applied to the arguments before computing
      expt.
    - #21: Modular arith bug 3
      Fixed by delaying the logand defoptimizer.
    - #15: x86 double-float issue
      Fixed when using SSE2 support.  We will not fix this for x87.
    - #25: Compiler bug
      Fixed.
    - #26: slot-value type check
      Fixed for some cases.  When used in methods, slot-value may not
      do the type check.if the object is not a argument to the method.

  * Other changes:
    - IS1, IS2, IS3, and IS4 are recognized character names for the
      ASCII control codes US, RS, GS, FS, respectively.
    - Added OPEN-NETWORK-STREAM and ACCEPT-NETWORK-STREAM functions.
    - When initializing a random state, try to read 627 words from
      /dev/urandom to initialize the entire state vector with random
      bits.  Previously, only one word was read.
    - A seed of 0 is allowed in KERNEL:INIT-RANDOM-STATE.
    - Updated User guide to include more examples of tracing.
    - Enable gencgc page protection on x86/darwin.  This can speed up
      GC a bit.  (Not measured.)
    - Bignum truncate is significantly faster.  Some cl-bench
      benchmarks are now almost twice as fast.
    - The continuable error produced by raising an integer to a power
      exceeding *intexp-maximum-exponent* is now a restart, giving the
      user the option to continue and update the limit to the new
      power.

  * Improvements to the PCL implementation of CLOS:
    - The compiler and interpreter should handle SLOT-VALUE the same
      way.  Previously, (SLOT-VALUE obj :a) would behave differently
      in the compiler and interpreter.
    - Some issues with get-accessor-method-function and
      slot-value-using-class have been fixed.
      Get-accessor-method-function was causing an error to be signaled
      incorrectly.
    - (setf (slot-value <obj> <slot>) <new>) will now signal an error
      in some situations when the new value is not of the correct
      declared type for slot.

  * Changes to building procedure:

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
19e; you will need to recompile FASL files.

We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
