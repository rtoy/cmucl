[In Progress]

The CMUCL project is pleased to announce the release of CMUCL 20f.
This is a major release which contains numerous enhancements and
bug fixes from the 20c release.

CMUCL is a free, high performance implementation of the Common Lisp
programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms. It
mainly conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard. CMUCL provides a
sophisticated native code compiler; a powerful foreign function
interface; an implementation of CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System,
which includes multi-methods and a meta-object protocol; a source-level
debugger and code profiler; and an Emacs-like editor implemented in
Common Lisp. CMUCL is maintained by a team of volunteers collaborating
over the Internet, and is mostly in the public domain.

New in this release:

  * Known issues:
    * Support for x87 will be dropped after the 2014-04 snapshot. All
      further snapshots will require an x86 chip that supports sse2.
      SSE2 was introduced with the Pentium 4 in 2001.

  * Feature enhancements
    * Trig functions are signficantly faster.
    * Accuracy of trig functions improved. (Previously, they could be
      off by one or two ulp.)
    * RUN-PROGRAM accepts :ELEMENT-TYPE to allow specifying the
      element type for streams that are created for RUN-PROGRAM.  (See
      ticket:92)

  * Changes
    * Update to ASDF 3.1.3.
    * When *PRINT-CASE* is :DOWNCASE, integers are printed with
      lowercase letters when needed.
    * Micro-optimize KERNEL:DOUBLE-FLOAT-BITS for x86/sse2.
    * Add micro-optimization for unary FTRUNCATE for x86/sse2.
    * Compiler can derive the types of the results of DECODE-FLOAT.
    * Main disassembly routines in the DISASSEMBLE package accept 
      :BASE, :CASE, and :RADIX keyword arguments, like
      DISASSEMBLE:DISASSEMBLE.
    * Micro optimizations for sse2 to allow descriptor regs and stack
      tns for many operations so that the operands can be in memory
      instead of a register, thereby removing a register load
      instruction.
    * Support for darwin/ppc 10.5 and gcc 4.8.
    * Micro-optimization:  (expt -1 power) just returns -1 or 1
      without actually computing the power.
    * Run-time checks for zero pages on newly allocated pages has been
      disabled now that the lazy zeroing of the heap pages has been
      the default for several months now.
    * Add lisp-unit as a contrib.  Use (require :lisp-unit) to load
      it.  Precompiled fasls are not included.
    * CMUCL now uses fdlibm C functions to implement the special
      functions. All platforms use this so they should produce
      identical results everywhere.
    * Consing for the trig functions is removed now since we call out
      to fdlibm instead of implementing them in Lisp.
    * Source location information has been added for
      DEFINE-CONDITION. (From Helmut Eller.)
    * The lisp executable is now compiled to use SSE2 on x86 machines;
      CMUCL will not run on chips without SSE2 anymore.
    * (cosh 1000d0) signals an overflow error as it
      should. Previously, it just incorrectly returned infinity.
    * Deprecating FLOAT-TRAPPING-NAN-P in favor of
      FLOAT-SIGNALING-NAN-P.  These kinds of numbers are called
      signaling NaNs, not trapping NaNs.
    * Changed the printer to print "Signaling" instead of "Trapping"
      when printing a signaling NaN.
    * Various issues with the switch to using fdlibm have been
      fixed. The issues were mostly not signaling floating-point
      exceptions in places where they were expected.
    * Restore the x87 FPU support on Linux; these are required because
      foreign functions and libraries can still use x87 even if cmucl
      itself does not. This is not required on Darwin because x87 is
      not used there.
    * On the ppc port, handle FP exceptions a bit better by not
      failing if cmucl is unable to interpret the instruction that
      caused the exception.
    * Microoptimization for sparc in rounding a double-float to a
      32-bit signed integer.
    * The compiler can now derive the type of ROUND. (But more work is
      needed.)
    * Fix an issue with multi-processing destroy-process doesn't take
      effect for a schedulable processbecause it has no run-reason
      and/or arrest-reason.

  * ANSI compliance fixes:
    * The values on the branch cuts for the inverse trig and
      hyperbolic functions have been updated.  Instead of following
      the text in the CLHS, the values are defined according to the
      definitions in the formulas.  In particular (atanh x) for x real
      and on the branch cut is now continuous with different
      quadrants.  This differs from the description of the branch cut
      for atanh in the CLHS.
    * CLEAR-OUTPUT was not actually doing anything. Now, CLEAR-OUTPUT
      will discard any buffered data that has not been written out
      yet.

  * Bugfixes:
    * Fix error in pi reduction on x87.  It was not noticed previously
      because the returned values were not used optimally.
    * Better error message for empty cond clauses.
    * Fix serious error in the complex multiply vop for sparc.
      Incorrect results were returned under some conditions when the
      result TN was packed in the same location as one of the argument
      TNs.
    * The float constants for various limits are defined for
      double-double floats such as
      least-positive-double-double-float. 
    * When reading very small float values, round to
      least-positive-foo-float if possible.
    * (log -0w0) and (log 0w0) returns values analogous to the
      double-float versions.
    * Fix bug in printing MOST-NEGATIVE-FIXNUM.
    * For Gray streams, CLEAR-OUTPUT was calling STREAM-FORCE-OUTPUT
      instead of STREAM-CLEAR-OUTPUT, so the output wasn't actually
      cleared.
    * In some situations KERNEL:DOUBLE-FLOAT-BITS on x86 would cause a
      segfault. This has been fixed.
    * For linux, motifd is no longer a 64-bit app.
    * (exp 1d0) now returns the correctly rounded value of
      e. Previously, it was off by one bit.
    * INTEGER-DECODE-FLOAT returns the correct values for denormal
      doubles. As a side-effect of this fix, DECODE-FLOAT returns the
      correct values for denormals, and SCALE-FLOAT scales denormals
      correctly.
    * EXT:UNIX-NAMESTRING no longer returns NIL if a directory does
      not exist. This was a regression from at least 18a.

This release is not binary compatible with code compiled using CMUCL
20e; you will need to recompile FASL files. 

See <URL:http://www.cmucl.org> or
<URL:http://trac.common-lisp.net/cmucl> for download information,
guidelines on reporting bugs, and mailing list details.


We hope you enjoy using this release of CMUCL!
