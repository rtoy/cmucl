.SH NAME
lisp \- CMU Common Lisp programming environment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lisp
[input-files] [switch-list]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I lisp
Starts up CMU Common Lisp.  If
.I switch-list
is empty, then Lisp will enter a read-eval-print loop using stdin, stdout and
stderr.  The optional 
.I input-files
provide operands for some switches.  These switches are defined:

.TP 10n
.BR \-help
Prints out the command line options and exits.
.TP
.BR \--help
Same as -help.
.TP
.BR \-core " filename"
Specifies the suspended Lisp image (or `core file') to start up.  
.TP
.BR \-lib " libpath"
A colon-separated list of directories to be used for the library: search-list.
.TP
.BR \-batch
Causes Lisp to run in batch mode, where all input is directed from
standard-input.
A unix return code of 0 is returned upon encountering an EOF, while any
unhandled error condition will cause an immediate exit with a return code
of 1, instead of entering the debugger.
.TP
.BR \-quiet
Causes Lisp to start up silently, disabling printing of the herald, and causing
most unnecessary noise, like GC messages, load messages, etc. to be suppressed.
.TP
.BR \-dynamic-space-size
Requires an argument that should be the number of megabytes (1048576 bytes)
that should be allocated to the heap.  If not specified, a platform-specific
default is used.  The actual maximum allowed heap size is platform-specific.
.TP
.TP
.BR \-read-only-space-size
Requires an argument that should be the number of megabytes (1048576 bytes)
that should be allocated to the read-only space.  If not specified, a platform-specific
default is used.
.TP
.TP
.BR \-static-space-size
Requires an argument that should be the number of megabytes (1048576 bytes)
that should be allocated to the static-space.  If not specified, a platform-specific
default is used.  The actual maximum allowed heap size is platform-specific.
.TP
.TP
.BR \-control-stack-size
Requires an argument that should be the number of megabytes (1048576 bytes)
that should be allocated for the control stack.  If not specified, a platform-specific
default is used.  The actual maximum allowed heap size is platform-specific.
.TP
.TP
.BR \-binding-stack-size
Requires an argument that should be the number of megabytes (1048576 bytes)
that should be allocated for the binding stack.  If not specified, a platform-specific
default is used.  The actual maximum allowed heap size is platform-specific.
.TP
.BR \-edit
Causes Lisp to enter the 
.I Hemlock
editor.
A file to edit may be specified by
placing the name of the file between the program name (usually `lisp') and
the first switch.  For this option to be defined, lisp must have hemlock
already loaded into the core.
.TP
.BR \-eval " expression"
Evaluates the specified Lisp
.I expression
during the start up sequence.  The value of the form will not be printed unless
it is wrapped in a form that does output.
.TP
.BR \-init " filename"
Specifies the name of a file containing user customizations that is to be
loaded each time Lisp starts up (default ~/init or ~/.cmucl-init.)  The loader
loads any existing compiled binary, or the ".lisp" source if none.
.TP
.BR \-hinit " filename"
Similar to \-init, but specifies the name of the
.I Hemlock
init file (default `~/hemlock-init' or ~/.hemlock-init), which is loaded only
when
.I Hemlock
is started.
.TP
.BR \-noinit
Suppresses loading of the init file, and also prevents \-edit from loading the
.I Hemlock
init file.
.TP
.BR \-nositeinit
Suppresses loading of the site-init site specific initialization file.
.TP
.BR \-load " filename"
Loads the specified file into Lisp before entering Lisp's read-eval-print loop.
.TP
.BR \-slave " editor-name"
Specifies that Lisp should start up as a 
.I slave
Lisp and try to
connect to an editor Lisp.  The name of the editor to connect to must be
specified.  For this option to be defined, lisp must have already
loaded hemlock into the core.  To find the editor's name, use the
.I Hemlock
`Accept Slave Connections' command.  
.I editor-name
is of the form `machine-name:socket', where
.I machine-name 
is the
internet host name for the machine and
.I socket
is the decimal number of the socket to connect to.
.TP
.BR \-debug-lisp-search
Enables printing of messages indicating how CMUCL is searching for its
core file.  This is useful if CMUCL is not finding its core file for
some reason.
.TP
.BR \-fpu " fpu-mode"
This option is only available on x86 systems.  This option takes the
values x87, sse2, or auto, with auto being the default.  With the
default value, CMUCL will check to see if the machine running CMUCL
supports SSE2 or not.  If so, the SSE2 core file is automatically
selected and used.  If not, the x87 core file is used.  With this
option, the user can override the detection and select a core.  (Note
that you cannot run the SSE2 core on a chip that doesn't not have
SSE2.  But the x87 core can run on any machine.)
.TP
.BR \--
If this option is given, CMUCL's argument processing is stopped, and
anything after "--" is placed in
EXT:*COMMAND-LINE-APPLICATION-ARGUMENTS*.  This allows the application
to its own processing of any special options.
.PP

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.TP 10n
.BR CMUCLLIB
This variable points to the `lib/' directory holding `lisp.core' and other
files used by Lisp at run-time.  This can be overridden by using the
-lib commandline option.
.TP
.BR CMUCLCORE
This variable holds the path to the `lisp.core' that that should be
used.  This can be overridden by using the -core commandline option.
.TP
.BR CMUCL_EMPTYFILE
[SunOS only] If `df /tmp' shows `swap' as the filesystem for the `/tmp'
directory, then you have a "tmpfs" filesystem.  In this case, you must setenv
CMUCL_EMPTYFILE to point into a pathname on a non-TMPFS filesystem that can be
used instead of `/tmp/empty'.
.TP
.BR XKEYSYMDB
In order to use Motif (and the graphical debugger) with X servers from
non-OSF vendors (like Sun) you may need to set the environment variable
XKEYSYMDB to point to the file `lib/XKeysymDB'.  Otherwise, you will get many
error messages every time a new connection is opened to the CMU CL motifd.
This file is read by the X11R5 Xt in order to augment the keysym database with
certain OSF vendor keysyms that Motif wants to use.

.SH CORE FILE SEARCHING
When no core file is specified (either by the CMUCLCORE environment
variable or by the -core option), CMUCL will search in various places to
find a possible core file. 

When the environment variable CMUCLLIB is set or the -lib option is
given, the lisp core file is searched in the places specified
therein.  This is a colon-separated list of directories, just like
PATH.  This list of directories is searched in order for a file named
`lisp.core'.  The first one found will be the core to be used.

When the CMUCLLIB is not set and -lib is not given, a set of default
paths is used to initialize the library: search-list, and this list is
also used to search for the core file.  Let the lisp C executable be
located at `<bin>/lisp'.  Then the following directories are searched
for the core file:

.TP 10n
.BR `<bin>'
.TP
.BR `<bin>/../lib/cmucl/lib'
.TP
.BR `<bin>/../lib'
.TP
.BR `/usr/local/lib/cmucl/lib'

.PP

.SH FILES

The following pathnames are specified relative to the directory where CMU CL is
installed, e.g. /usr/local.

.TP 10n
.BR doc/cmucl/*
Various postscript and text documentation files.
.TP
.BR bin/lisp
The lisp startup program.  This directory should be in PATH.
.TP

An example shell script that setups up the environment and run lisp.
This is not normally needed unless you want some special
configuration. 
.TP
.BR lib/cmucl/lib/lisp.core

named lisp-x87.core or lisp-sse2.core, depending on whether the x87 or
sse2 core is used.
.TP
.BR lib/cmucl/lib/site-init.lisp, generic-site.lisp
Site specific initialization (see README file.)  The generic-site.lisp
file is a template that can be used to create site-init.lisp.  (Note:
installation of CMUCL does not create or destroy any site-init.lisp file.)
.TP
.BR lib/cmucl/lib/lisp.a

creating and executable image.

image.
.TP

.SH BUGS

Consult http://www.cons.org/cmucl/support.html for support
information, including mechanisms for bug reporting.  Please consult
your local CMU CL maintainer or Common Lisp expert if any to verify
that a problem really is a bug before reporting it.

Known problems with this version:
.TP 3
--
Detection of stack overflow is not very graceful.   You get many "map
failure" errors on stderr.
.TP 3
--
If file descriptors are used up, then Lisp will die.
.TP 3
\--
Several proposed ANSI Common Lisp (CLtL II) features are not implemented:
Any CLOS features not implemented by PCL, and features added since the first
ANSI draft.
.TP 3
\--
The interpreter's pre-processing freezes in the macro definitions in effect at
the time an interpreted function is defined.
