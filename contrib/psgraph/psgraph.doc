Here is a brief summary of how to use the PSgrapher.

The PSgrapher is a set of Lisp routines that can be called to produce
Postscript commands to display a directed acyclic graph.  It uses the same
basic algorithm as the ISI Grapher.  It is slower than the ISI grapher, but
produces much prettier output than using Xdump to copy an ISI Grapher screen
image to a Postscript printer.  It also allows arbitrary information to be
displayed with a node, and can print as many output pages as are necessary to
accomodate large graphs (subject to Postscript printer limits, typically one or
two thousand nodes).

The PSgrapher is small enough and easy enough to use to be included in other
systems without pain.  It is also free and not copyrighted.

Copy the file /afs/cs/project/clisp/library/psgraph/psgraph.lisp to your
directory.  It is written in Common Lisp, and has been tested on CMU Common
Lisp on RTs and Lucid on SUNs.  All interfaces described below are exported
from the "PSGRAPH" package.

There are several useful global variables that can be modified and one function
to be called.  The variables affect the style of the printed image, the
function walks a graph and produces output.

A graph is defined by a root node and a function for getting children of a
node.  Nodes are named by Lisp objects, and these names are checked using a
user-supplied test function (defaults to EQUAL) for purposes of walking the
graph and topologically sorting it.  Typically one uses atoms to name nodes,
for example in graphing an inheritence net one could use the class names as
node names.

To produce a graph call the function:
    (psgraph:psgraph root-node-name
		     child-function
		     info-function
		     &optional (shrink nil)
		     &optional (insert nil)
		     &optional (test #'equal))

Root-node-name is a Lisp object naming the root of the graph (there must be
exactly one root).

Child-function takes a node name and returns a list of node names.

Info-function takes a node name and returns a list of strings.  Each string
shows up as one line in the printed form of the node, with the first string
displayed in one font (determined by variables *fontname*, *fontsize*) and the
others in another font (determined by variables *second-fontname*,
*second-fontsize*).  Typically the first string is just the name of the node,
eg, (string node-name).

Shrink is a boolean.  It defaults to nil, and in this case the graph
prints on as many pages as are needed to show the whole thing.  If shrink
is t then the entire graph is squashed appropriately to fit on one page
of output.

Insert is a boolean.  It defaults to nil, and in this case the generated
Postscript file contains commands to print the output.  If insert is t
then the output file is always shrunk (shrink is t) and no commands are
generated to print the page.  This means the resulting file can be included
in Scribe files, for example, and Scribe can decide when to print the page.

Test is a function that return whether two nodes are the same.

After loading psgraph, one can play with the various global variables, all of
which have string values (except for the two font size variables).  *fontname*,
*fontsize*, *second-fontname*, *second-fontsize* are as described above.  They
default to "Helvetica" in 10 point and "Helvetica-Oblique" in 8 point,
respectively.  *boxgray* and *boxkind* determine how the boxes around nodes
look.  *boxkind* is either "fill" or "stroke", for solid or outline boxes, and
*boxgray* is "0" for solid black, "1" for solid white, or in between.  These
default to ".2" and "stroke".

Other variables:
   *max-psnodes*
   *extra-x-spacing*
   *extra-y-spacing*
   *edgewidth*
   *edgegray*
   *edgecap*
   *textgray*
   *pageheight*
   *pagewidth*
   *boxradius*
   *boxedge*
   *chunksize*


Psgraph sends its output to *standard-output*, so typically it is called
from within (with-open-file  ....).  For example, one might use it like this:

   (load "psgraph.fasl")
   (setf psgraph:*boxkind* "fill")
   (setf psgraph:*boxgray* ".8")
   (setf psgraph:*fontsize* 8)
   (setf psgraph:*second-fontsize* 6)

   (defun graph (&optional (shrink t))
     (with-open-file (*standard-output* "g.ps"
		      :direction :output
		      :if-exists :supersede)
	  (psgraph:psgraph 'A #'children #'info shrink nil #'eq)))

   (defun children (x)
      (cond ((eq x 'A) '(B C D))
	    ((member x '(B C D)) '(E F G))
	    ((member x '(E F G)) '(H))
	    (t nil)))

   (defun info (x)
      (list (string x)))


Another example:
   (defun code-graph-to-file (s file &optional shrink insert)
     (let ((psgraph:*fontname* "Times-Roman")
	   (psgraph:*fontsize* 8)
	   (psgraph:*second-fontname* "Times-BoldItalic")
	   (psgraph:*second-fontsize* 6)
	   (psgraph:*boxgray* "0")
	   (psgraph:*edgegray* "0")
	   (psgraph:*extra-x-spacing* 30))
       (with-open-file (*standard-output* file
					  :direction :output
					  :if-exists :supersede)
	 (psgraph:psgraph s #'psg-children #'psg-info shrink insert #'eq))))
